# UCAS_course_script
A script to enroll in courses for graduate students of University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
# 2021.9.1 Modification
You can search "20212" in "UCAS_course.py" and replace the "xxx" with your student number.
Finally, run it! Have fun!!
# Note
I only modified the UCAS_course.py and tested it!
I don't know what the status of another two files if you run them. According to the records, they were submited long time ago.
